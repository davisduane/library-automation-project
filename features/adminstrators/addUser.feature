Feature: Add Users Functionality

    As an admin, I should be able to add users on the "Users" page.

    Scenario 1: Navigate to the "Users" Page

Given I am logged in as an admin
When I navigate to the main dashboard
And I click on the "Users" link
Then I should be taken to the "Users" page


    #! Acceptance Criteria are missing :(


    #TODO: Analyze the user story and create acceptance criteria yourself!


    #TODO: Create scenarios that cover all the acceptance criteria
